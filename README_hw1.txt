It was very difficult to implement many I/O methods as they were not really explored in class, and many of the methods were difficult to find valuable documentation. Also, assignment instructions were sort of scattered around, i.e. some in the assignment pdf, some over Piazza, so it was a little hard to follow. On top of this, we had to take care of runtime as well, which made it extra difficult. The auto grade also added a layer of complexity to the entire submission.

Learned a lot about different types of I/O files, especially BufferedReader and RandomAccessFile. Also thought the compareTo() method was interesting.
